# pts-docker-benchmark
Illustrates how to use Phoronix Test Suite in a container to run your own customized benchmarks.

The basic idea is that you fork this repository and customize the `Dockerfile`, but you may also use the pre-built
images (see [packages](https://github.com/users/MShekow/packages?repo_name=pts-docker-benchmark))
